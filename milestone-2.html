      <h1>Background and Rationale</h1>
      <div class="background-wrapper">
        <p>
          Inclusive mathematics education values human diversity and ensures
          that all students can progress academically and develop holistically
        </p>
        <p>
          EDI (Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion) supports respectful, safe, and
          equitable learning environments where all students feel valued and
          included.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inclusive math classrooms use varied pedagogical approaches and
          teaching resources that allow all learners—regardless of background or
          ability—to participate meaningfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some university students still report inadequate learning resources
          and facilities, highlighting the need for continued support to
          strengthen inclusive practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          First-year university students will conduct a campus tour to observe
          learning facilities, gather data, and assess how these resources
          influence engagement and sense of belonging.
        </p>
        <p>
          Findings from the visit aim to provide recommendations for improving
          inclusive mathematics education, supporting student engagement, and
          enhancing campus learning environments.

          >“Tour to Know: Mathematics Freshmen's Impressions of the Learning
          Environment and Resources”
        </span>
        is an observational campus tour for students. Guided by an admission
        officer, participants will visit university facilities and observe real
        classroom lessons. The tour aims to help students evaluate the learning
        environment, available resources, and teaching approaches to determine
        whether the institution meets their academic needs.

      <h1>Objectives / Expected Outcomes</h1>
      <p>
        1. To increase first-year students’ awareness of the school’s learning
        environment and available academic resources by 80%, as measured through
        post-tour feedback and reflection forms collected at the end of the
        activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. To assess and document at least three areas for improvement in the
        inclusivity and accessibility of learning spaces, based on the analysis
        of student feedback and observation reports gathered during the tour.

      <h1>Theoretical and Scholarly Support</h1>

          According to Vithal (2023), A systematic review of equity-related
          studies in mathematics education from 2017 to 2022 was conducted,
          revealing five main topics: equity understanding, fair teaching
          practices, curriculum availability, and system practices.
        </li>
        <li>
          According to Abtahi & Planas (2024), A framework has been established
          that connects EDI with mathematics instruction and teacher preparation
          to fight against exclusion.
        </li>
        <li>
          According to Wang et al. (2023), Social Cognitive Career Theory was
          applied to analyze gender disparities in STEM interest, and it was
          found that self-efficacy, social support, and exposure have distinct
          effects on the engagement of males and females.
